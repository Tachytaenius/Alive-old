* Don't let entities that move more than a tile's width per tick exist.
* Make sure that the setMode defaults are still what we want the new version if the framework updates.
* Always use table.insert and table.remove when dealing with the play state's lists to keep ipairs working (which we need because pairs isn't deterministic.)
* See lib/HC/alive-changes.txt
